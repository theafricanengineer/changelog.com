  ## Things we do

    - Yes: "Webamp now includes MilkDrop ðŸ¤˜"
    - No:  "Webamp Now Includes MilkDrop ðŸ¤˜"
  - We use the oxford comma.
     - Yes: "Lightweight, beautiful, and user-friendly interactive prompts"
     - No: "Lightweight, beautiful and user-friendly interactive prompts"
  - We prefer "open source" to "open-source".
  - We attribute pull quotes with author name and link when appropriate.
  - We link to external resources (definitions, references, etc) liberally.
  - We address the reader directly with questions, advice, opinions, etc.

  ## Things we don't

  - We don't flame or call out people or projects. Healthy skepticism and concerns are legit, but we don't use destructive language or tone.
