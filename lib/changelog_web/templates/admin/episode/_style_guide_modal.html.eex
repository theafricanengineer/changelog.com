  The title's primary purpose is to **make people want to listen**. Its secondary purpose is to **be memorable** so that people can easily refer to it. Finally, it's always nice when a title includes search-friendly keywords to feed The Algorithms. Guidelines:

  - Always write titles in sentence case. They're more conversational/informal than title case, and read better in creative forms.
    - Yes: So you have an AI model, now what?
    - No:  So You Have an AI Model, Now What?
  - Strive to create interesting, playful titles whenever possible
    - Drupal is a pretty big deal
    - What up, docs? ðŸ¥•
    - Kubernetes brings all the Cloud Natives to the yard
    - Fantastic bugs and how to squash them
  - Include prominent names/projects/companies when applicable
    - The Great GatsbyJS
    - UBER and Intelâ€™s Machine Learning platforms
    - The impact of AI at Microsoft
  - Sometimes interesting is tough to achieve. Fall back to descriptive
    - Segment's transition back to a monorepo
    - Rebuilding Exercism from the ground up
  - As a last resort, a comma-separated list of topics _works_ (but kinda sucks)
    - Code Cartoons, Rust, WebAssembly
    - Curl turns 20, HTTP/2, QUIC
  - Phone a friend! The best titles are often created collaboratively. We love working together to 'birth' a great title.
